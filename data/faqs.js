        q: 'Can you build a tolerance to nootropics?',
        a: "Yes, it's possible to build a tolerance to certain nootropics, meaning you'll need higher doses over time to achieve the same effects. Caffeine is a common example where tolerance can develop quickly. To avoid tolerance, some users cycle their nootropics, taking breaks to reset their sensitivity to the substance."

However, combining nootropics should be done carefully to avoid potential interactions or side effects. Research and caution are essential."
